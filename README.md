🐍 FAI Project: Teaching AI to Play Snake! (Reinforcement Learning with PyTorch)
This project implements a Deep Q-Learning (DQL) agent to learn how to play the classic game Snake, built from scratch using Pygame for the environment and PyTorch for the neural network.

The code and models within this repository represent the culmination of our work on the Final Artificial Intelligence (FAI) Project.

🌟 Project Overview
Our objective was to implement and train a Reinforcement Learning agent to achieve optimal gameplay in Snake. This repository contains:

The Snake Game Environment: Built using Pygame.

The Deep Q-Learning Agent: Logic for move prediction, memory, and training.

Trained Models: Checkpoint files showing the agent's progress.

Video Demonstration: A video showcasing the final trained model's performance.

📚 Getting Started
Prerequisites
To run this project, you will need the following Python libraries:

Python 3.x

PyTorch

Pygame

Other dependencies listed in requirements.txt

Installation
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/Adil-Khan-N/FAI-project.git
cd FAI-project
Install dependencies:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the Project
To run the game or train the agent, execute the main Python file (typically agent.py or snake_game.py - adjust the filename as necessary).
